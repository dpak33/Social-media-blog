This is a full stack blog application. It handles user signup and signin on the backend and allows users to navigate to various pages that show blogs (with images) that they alone have posted, as well as all blogs that have been posted by all users. Users can edit and delete their own blogs as required. It is fairly extensively tested on the frontend but the backend has only been tested - albeit thoroughly - using Postman. I've set up a third server under the workspace folder, which I have used to proxy the generation of images to the site as I was unable to load the images previously owing to restrictions regarding cross-origin resource sharing. The workspace folder is constituted of a set of libraries that can be extracted from Github ad have been made publicly available. I intend to add backend testing in the future and ultimately would like to deploy the app. In order to get it running on your machine, you would simply need to run npm i on the front and backend before setting up your own .env file.
