This is a full-stack blog-posting application (with associated images). It handles user signup and signin on the backend and allows users to navigate to various pages. These show, for example, the catalogue of blogs associated only with the present user, of those associated with all users and finally an input form for the user to create a new blog while logged into the app. Users can edit and delete their own blogs as required. These are handled the relevant HTTP requests on the backend.  It is fairly extensively tested on the frontend but the backend has only been tested - albeit thoroughly - using Postman. I've set up a third server under the workspace folder, which I have used to proxy the generation of images to the site as I was unable to load the images previously owing to restrictions regarding cross-origin resource sharing. The workspace folder is constituted of a set of libraries that can be extracted from Github and have been made publicly available. I intend to add backend testing in the future and ultimately would like to deploy the app using Render and Netlify. In order to get it running on your machine, you would simply need to run npm i in each of the repositories after setting up your own .env file as a link to a MongoDB resource.
